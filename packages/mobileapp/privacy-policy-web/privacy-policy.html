                        <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
                        <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                                legislations the Owner
                                may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
                                (“opt-out”), without
                                having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does
                                not apply, whenever
                                the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or
                                for any
                                pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                                subject;</li>
                            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                                exercise of official
                                authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
                                Owner or by a third
                                party.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
                            the processing, and
                            in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
                            requirement, or a requirement
                            necessary to enter into a contract. </p>
                        <h3>Place</h3>
                        <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the
                            parties involved in the
                            processing are located.<br /><br />
                            Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to
                            a country other
                            than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data,
                            Users can check the
                            section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                        <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside
                            the European Union
                            or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two
                            or more countries,
                            such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their
                            Data.<br /><br />
                            If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections
                            of this document or
                            inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

                        <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have

                                retained as long as
                                needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
                                legitimate interests
                                pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                                Owner.</li>

                            processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
                            to retain Personal
                            Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal

                            Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of
                            access, the right to
                            erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
                            after expiration of the

                        <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official
                            authority vested in the
                            Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object
                            to such processing
                            by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
                        <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing
                            purposes, they can
                            object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether
                            the Owner is
                            processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant

                            provided in this
                            document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner
                            as early as possible
                            and always within one month.</p>

                            disseminating, making
                            available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic

                            personal information by the business to <strong>another business or a third party, for
                                monetary or other

                        <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes
                            statistical analyses
                            on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and
                            the like.</p>

                            exceptions set forth by

                        <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
                        <p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by
                            contacting us via the
                            details provided in this document.</p>
                        <p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you
                            can only exercise the
                            above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person
                                about whom we
                                collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
                            <li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
                                evaluate, and respond to
                                it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore
                            confirm the personal
                            information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
                        <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered
                            with the California
                            Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>
                        <p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your
                            parental authority.</p>
                        <p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p>

                        <h4>How and when we are expected to handle your request</h4>

                            about how we will

                        <p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we
                            will explain to you
                            the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may
                            take up to 90 days to
                            fulfill your request.</p>
                        <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>
                        <p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
                        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request
                            is manifestly
                            unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on
                            the request. In
                            either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>
